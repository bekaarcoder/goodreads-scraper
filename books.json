        "description": "A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERA Today Show #ReadwithJenna Book Club Pick\n\nA propulsive and uncommonly wise novel about one unexpected wedding guest and the surprising people who help her start anew. It\u2019s a beautiful day in Newport, Rhode Island, when Phoebe Stone arrives at the grand Cornwall Inn wearing a green dress and gold heels, not a bag in sight, alone. She's immediately mistaken by everyone in the lobby for one of the wedding people, but she\u2019s actually the only guest at the Cornwall who isn\u2019t here for the big event. Phoebe is here because she\u2019s dreamed of coming for years\u2014she hoped to shuck oysters and take sunset sails with her husband, only now she\u2019s here without him, at rock bottom, and determined to have one last decadent splurge on herself. Meanwhile, the bride has accounted for every detail and every possible disaster the weekend might yield except for, well, Phoebe and Phoebe's plan\u2014which makes it that much more surprising when the two women can\u2019t stop confiding in each other.  In turns absurdly funny and devastatingly tender, Alison Espach\u2019s The Wedding People is ultimately an incredibly nuanced and resonant look at the winding paths we can take to places we never imagined\u2014and the chance encounters it sometimes takes to reroute us.",

        "description": "\nWomen can be heroes.\n When twenty-year-old nursing student Frances \u201cFrankie\u201d McGrath hears these words, it is a revelation. Raised in the sun-drenched, idyllic world of Southern California and sheltered by her conservative parents, she has always prided herself on doing the right thing. But in 1965, the world is changing, and she suddenly dares to imagine a different future for herself. When her brother ships out to serve in Vietnam, she joins the Army Nurse Corps and follows his path. As green and inexperienced as the men sent to Vietnam to fight, Frankie is over- whelmed by the chaos and destruction of war. Each day is a gamble of life and death, hope and betrayal; friendships run deep and can be shattered in an instant. In war, she meets\u2014and becomes one of\u2014the lucky, the brave, the broken, and the lost. But war is just the beginning for Frankie and her veteran friends. The real battle lies in coming home to a changed and divided America, to angry protesters, and to a country that wants to forget Vietnam. The Women is the story of one woman gone to war, but it shines a light on all women who put themselves in harm\u2019s way and whose sacrifice and commitment to their country has too often been forgotten. A novel about deep friendships and bold patriotism, The Women is a richly drawn story with a memorable heroine whose idealism and courage under fire will come to define an era.",
